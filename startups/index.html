                    We need money now
                    to get to the launch ready version.
                    The app has not been publically launched and hence, has traction only in double figures.
                    Therefore, there has been no need for us yet to have dabbled in cost or revenue
                    projections.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I bring to YOU our need for a minimum of $200,000 to build a <strong>'launch
                        worthy'</strong>
                    productivity tool as a
                    chat first
                    application for android as our first step towards this vision expressed as step 0 to step 2.
                    At
                    modest estimates, I
                    envision 1
                    million users in one year with just that much money.

                            Non-negotiable, for if you are investing in us you already feel there is a
                            potential of billions of dollars in value creation. $2.5 million today is
                            1/1000th
                            of that value creation potential.

                            I know there are a lot of Sunny Kesarwani's out there, just like, we are all
                            the
                            same, but only in our absolute silence. The moment we start surfacing after
                            our
                            long silence, as individuals, we realize there is just one Sunny Kesarwani,
                            who
                            decided to say no to all opportunities where traction and team were a far
                            easier
                            find. I decided to chase a chat app instead, in spite of the world of
                            potential
                            colleagues that thought this won't work, because the world doesn't need
                            another
                            chat app. Let's understand that one of us out of millions of us can be
                            allowed
                            to break the rule of getting to an investor before traction, because he is
                            building a product that cannot come out as a MVP. Give me a minimum of
                            $200,000
                            absolutely
                            now and let me have my team full time. In three months we will build the
                            most
                            beautiful chat app in the world. Then give us the rest of money to launch it
                            to
                            the world.

                            There is no criteria for minimum value we may agree to, for, to have a good
                            man
                            as an investor, a man whose vibe I like, we may be willing to lower the
                            monetary
                            value of Chattodo.

                            In the short term: <br> <br>
                            1. 1 year - The next round of investment our value, and hence your
                            investment’s
                            value, will be doubled with just 1000 active users. <br>
                            2. We can bring back to life the dying billion dollar products like
                            Evernote,
                            wunderlist (microsoft), alive if they acquire us. <br>
                            3. We have our eyes set on exploring a multi-million dollar part buy-out by
                            Angelist. <br>
                            <br>
                            Exit in the long-term for the investor - Whats App was acquired for $20
                            billion
                            in 6 years. This will be too. By who? Facebook. Why? Facebook wants to be
                            number
                            1 in work collaboration space too, which we will win.
                            Who doesn’t want to own an effective communication tool? Microsoft, Google,
                            LInkedIn to Indian - Airtel, Directi, zoho?

                        <br>
                        <i> We have developed the prototype, not the launch version of the app. Why? Like
                            we said above - just imagine, will you use a chatting app in 2017 which looks and feels
                            worse than Whatsapp, Slack, Snapchat or Fb messenger? We won't. So for us to make the
                            presence of our app felt, we must spend at least 100 thousand dollars to actually build
                            a finger licking beautiful product to launch it with the optimism that it will eat up
                            some of the market share of communication away from Whatsapp, FB messenger and Slack.
                            This implies that every waking hour of ours must go into the broad understanding of the
                            market, vision and team camaraderie first; then the development of the app, then the
                            launch of the app, and then following of metrics and somewhere along the way, dabbling
                            in projections will happen.<br>

                            No traction yet for the main mobile app. Why? Why am I still pursuing investment when
                            there is not even a launch?
                            Because this product is about a chatapp. Chatting apps cannot be made and launched as
                            half baked MVPs for the world
                            We need investment to support the team so that our great team can continue to build a
                            great product with some confidence in the captain, that is I, that I will take care of
                            their bread and butter. Not everyone required in this team will have the same appetite
                            for risk as I.
                            Traction we have achieved so far: None. So far we were not chasing traction. We were
                            fighting personal odds and chasing a vision & design that required years of sacrifices
                            away from the norms of chasing traction common to apps with lesser time to chase vision,
                            because they are too busy chasing the incremental changes in the status quo.</i>

                            <b> Why the standard question of traction may not be the most
                                appropriate question for a moonshot innovation in its nascent stage when
                                founders are seeking support from investors to continue their R&D
                                towards
                                launch?</b> <br><br>

                            For now, let's turn the lens on another kind of traction- which we have
                            already created- meaningful moments and activities noticed by users, media
                            and the tech community. <br><br>
                            I often wonder if my life would be the same inspired life if I was chasing
                            traction instead of a chasing a world changing vision which did not fit the
                            bill for the rule of - build MVP - followed by traction, before I could
                            raise money. Please tell me how I would then change the world for the

                            Start-up land is littered with failure. <br><br>
                            Every hack on smart investing will preach that before approaching an
                            investor you must have dragged your feet over the thorns littered over that
                            holiest of grails- TRACTION. For after all what good is a business that does
                            not yield profits? Yet, if that critical question on TRACTION is duly asked
                            and answered before any investment, why the high rates of failure and a
                            subsequent celebration of failure as the norm in start-up land?
                            Could it be that the holy grail itself is flawed in a period where most of
                            our problems have been solved or are perceived to have been solved to an
                            acceptable degree beyond which improvements are not possible in a human,
                            hence imperfect world? <br><br>
                            I say YES. <br><br>
                            Most start-ups offer incremental changes, but what if you had a moon- shot
                            innovation for a problem the world has ceased to consider as one. Or a
                            problem considered solved? <br><br>
                            Moonshots, by their very definition, need to be hurtled until something big
                            is identified. The innovation after that identification might take time, in
                            some cases, a very long time. (Would you not say that the problem you are
                            addressing is a blind spot- that the best in chatting-productivity has been
                            achieved and that is just the start of the moon shot you must make to
                            disrupt existing models of education?)

                            Yes, you can’t code, don’t have the time to learn so you hire the best
                            to code for you. It must not surprise you that great people come at a
                            cost. Those great people may have had a life of their own before they
                            met a vision that I imparted to them and wished to be consumed by it but
                            for the mundane but real considerations of everyday living. <br><br>
                            More so, one requires neat sums of money for the world will not accept a

                            So, my challenge is to manifest a never-before vision into a
                            finger-licking good looking product that elicits a collective gasp of
                            “why did we not see that earlier”, from the world. <br><br>
                            (To those who repeat the trite Form Follows Function rule, let me quote
                            just one example- Snapchat, that turned that norm on its head. It was a
                            beautiful but tedious product to begin with. It bettered itself over
                            time) <br><br>
                            Money, of course- now. <br><br>

                            a<br>
                            greater team efficiency through the motivation of consistent payment of
                            salaries. Most of the money required is to go into hiring the team full time
                            under one creativity inducing roof. Currently our team is not full time,
                            they
                            have a job, and all they ask is some investment in our company immediately
                            so
                            there is some job security they have in terms of salary and infrastructure
                            to do
                            good work.

                            Once this is done my first step of marketing will be to go and pitch it to
                            the
                            best companies in Silicon Valley.
                            <a href="http://preseeded.preseed.in">Preseeded.preseed.in</a> is being
                            planned
                            and built for the future more than the present status quo. <br> <br>
                            Reading it will keep your awareness about us, all the way, to the future. We
                            will soo pitch Chattodo to employees of companies like Twitter, Google etc.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For this I will be speaking directly with two of my good friends - YC
                            Almunus,
                            Sachin, who had also serveed as a Product manager Twitter. When that time
                            comes.
                            That is our core focused marketing which I will do myself. Through them I
                            will
                            try to get it into the hands of the employees of those companies. I will
                            focus
                            on that. That is the kind of start I want from my own marketing time spent.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So I build the product and pitch it to employees of top companies. That will
                            be
                            the highest use case of Chattodo I want to focus on that. And just that. It
                            entails, building a great product, and then talking to great people about
                            it.
                            <br> <br>
                            Also writing to best media blogs in the world about it. I want the start of
                            my
                            personal marketing effort to happen from there.
                            I will stick to what I am good at, writing, I will write a thorough article
                            about productivity and the future of roofless offices and distributed teams.
                            All
                            the way to how ideas can be built without capital and with Todoed and some
                            faith
                            in one another. This article would have the potential to be read by 1000s of
                            impactful early stage entrepreneurs.
